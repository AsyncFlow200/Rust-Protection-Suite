**A lightweight PowerShell tool for quick scanning of the RUST game client for potential unauthorized software traces.**

This repository contains a PowerShell script designed for rapid, surface-level scanning of **RUST** game files and environment to detect inconsistencies and "red flags" that *may* indicate the presence of cheats or macros.

&gt; **⚠️ Important Notice:** This tool is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** intended for basic visual inspection. It is not a full-fledged anti-cheat solution and does not guarantee 100% detection. Its primary purpose is quick preliminary analysis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the checker with a single command in PowerShell.

**Prerequisite:** Launch **PowerShell as Administrator**.

Copy and execute the following command:
## **General**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex (iwr 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrackOnion/cheat-checker/refs/heads/main/CheatCheckerRust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing).Content
```
